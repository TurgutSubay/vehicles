# vehicles
For the chalange
I used PHP PHP 8.1.4,symfony 6.0.*, jquery-3.1.1, bootstrap 4.6.1 and jquery dataTables.
I send almost 2 days for this challenge mostly Saturday and Sunday.
Because of time limitation i did not finish some task.
Still filters work independent("filters depend on each other")
and I planed to add sub tables for parts but still did not finished.  

The challenge looks like my daily job and i am developing like this simple task every day.  
You can check my code style:
How i load data to mySQL  src\Command\LoadPartData.php and src\Command\LoadVehicleData
How i used Controller src\Controller\MainController
How i used Repository src\Repository\VehiclesRepository.php

I think all these codes gives you feedback how i used your technology stack
"Symfony full-stack framework, Doctrine ORM and MySQL together with Frontend stack JavaScript,
jQuery and Bootstrap 4"
